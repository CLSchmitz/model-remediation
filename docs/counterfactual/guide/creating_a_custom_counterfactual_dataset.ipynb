        "Unlike your training dataset, you don’t need to include labels in your counterfactual dataset. However, the data must be the same as the training dataset, with sensitive terms replaced or removed (depending on the type of correlation you are aiming to test). You also need to ensure that there are a sufficient number of sensitive attributes to get a meaningful result. \n",

        "1.   Use build_counterfactual_dataset to pass a list of words that will be removed from the dataset via tf.strings.regex_replace.\n",
        "2.   Create a custom function to pass to build_counterfactual_dataset to change the counterfactual. This might include using more specific regex functions or replacing words within your original dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "When using simple regex to create the counterfactual dataset, keep in mind that this may augment words that shouldn’t be changed, which could impact performance. It is important to understand your original dataset along with the counterfactual dataset to help produce an appropriate pairing for your model.\n",
